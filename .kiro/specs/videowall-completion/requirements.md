# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature completes the CRT Cyberpunk Video Wall project by implementing the remaining packaging, installation, and code quality components. The project is a Raspberry Pi 4 application that displays video clips with dynamic overlay text and retro visual effects on CRT monitors, and needs proper installation automation and development workflow tools to be production-ready.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user installing the VideoWall application, I want an automated post-installation script, so that all necessary files are copied to the correct locations and the application is ready to use without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the postinstall.sh script is executed THEN the system SHALL copy the mpv Lua script (core/player.lua) to ~/.config/videowall/
2. WHEN the postinstall.sh script is executed THEN the system SHALL copy all HUD modules from core/hud/modules/ to ~/.config/videowall/hud/modules/
3. WHEN the postinstall.sh script is executed THEN the system SHALL copy filter presets and shaders to ~/.config/videowall/filters/
4. WHEN the postinstall.sh script is executed THEN the system SHALL create default profile configurations from the presets/ directory
5. WHEN the postinstall.sh script is executed THEN the system SHALL set appropriate file permissions for all copied files
6. WHEN the postinstall.sh script is executed THEN the system SHALL create a sample message file in the assets/messages/ location
7. IF any required directories do not exist THEN the script SHALL create them with proper permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on the VideoWall project, I want automated code quality tools, so that code consistency and quality are maintained across contributions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run pre-commit hooks to validate code quality
2. WHEN Python code is checked THEN the system SHALL validate syntax and style using appropriate linters
3. WHEN Lua code is checked THEN the system SHALL validate syntax using the existing test_lua_syntax.sh script
4. WHEN JSON configuration files are modified THEN the system SHALL validate them against the schema
5. IF any quality checks fail THEN the commit SHALL be rejected with clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer or user, I want comprehensive installation documentation, so that I can easily set up the VideoWall application on a fresh Raspberry Pi system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN following the installation instructions THEN all system dependencies SHALL be clearly listed with installation commands
2. WHEN following the installation instructions THEN the Python virtual environment setup SHALL be documented with exact commands
3. WHEN following the installation instructions THEN the post-installation steps SHALL be clearly explained
4. WHEN following the installation instructions THEN troubleshooting common issues SHALL be documented

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all project components are properly integrated and tested, so that the VideoWall application works reliably across different configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is installed THEN all Lua modules SHALL be properly integrated with the mpv player
2. WHEN different video formats are played THEN the filters and shaders SHALL apply correctly
3. WHEN HUD modules are loaded THEN they SHALL display accurate system information
4. WHEN configuration profiles are switched THEN the application SHALL load the correct settings
5. WHEN the message overlay system is triggered THEN it SHALL display text correctly over video content
